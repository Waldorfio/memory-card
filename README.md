# Project: Memory Card Game
A CV application website, developed to enforce my learnings on React fundamentals (components and states management).
Application developed using React.js and CSS. Built using the create-react-app.

### Features
- Allows users to create their own resume using a ready made template

### Goals
- Practice the fundamentals of state and component management with Class based components
- Create a dynamic app with multiple components and states

### Challenges Faced
- Creating a stateful app with multiple children able to make dynamic changes to the parent state
- Passing states between children and parents -> pass functions setting the state for two way state management
- Key management: neatly creating keys for states and passing them between compoonents
- Adapting to class based component syntax in React
